Dear visitor,

Before you start looking true my projects you should know few things :).
I have few projects: "Project", "MyWeb", "Spring_Web_App". And I will say something for each of them.

Project:
  In this project there are 4 packages , one is main who organize panels and let you chose witch one you want to see. There is
    Invasion, space invaders game, SQL JDBC and Animation. I will just talk about SQL JDBC, few directions for easy start.
  For SQL I used XAMPP Apache and made connection true bean "connect.xsm". I set up localhost with my local name and pass,
    before you start you need to change to your local name and pass or if you use ip then enter ip and name-pass. If that is 
    good then all should run just fine. And if you have some exceptions then you did not set up right.
    
MyWeb:

  Standard servlet classes that use request and response, JSP file, Tomcat server. I did not want to save data or to expend more.
    This project is just to practice, and try servlets, also to for learning.
  All you need is right click on project and run as Maven build, then write in Goals: tomcat7:run. In console you will see link.
  
Spring_Web_App:

  Spring MVC project, all I did is setup, it show first page. All now I need is a design :).
  To start go to class Login_Controller and right click - Run ass - Run on Server.
  
  
For all questions you can contact me on mail 21032988nikola@gmail.com. 

All best,
Nikola Jovanovic
