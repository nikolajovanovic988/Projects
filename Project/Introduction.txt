Hello,

  This is my virtual interview :). And my
way to say more about me. I will start
from begining.

  I started with book "The Art and
Science of Java" by Eric S. Roberts.
The book was folowing course led by
Mehran Sahami, in Stanford University.
I finished all assigments and exams.
The course and the book is teaching
about programming methodology. It was
hard and chalanging at beggining, but
soon it began to become clearer, and
it was easyer after.
  HTML and CSS was next I learnd and then
Git and Github. And then SQL, MySQL.
  Next was another book
